    <p>Intended misspelling of HTML, a front-end programming language used to define elements in a website. As with many intended misspellings,

    <p>This acronym is also used as an 'inside joke' amongst designers and coders alike, preferably used when around people that are less knowledgeable in the field of front-end programming.</p>
